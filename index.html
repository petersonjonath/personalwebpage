<p>
I'm an assistant professor of Sanskrit and premodern South Asia in the Department of Middle Eastern, South Asian, and African
Studies (MESAAS) at Columbia University. I work on Sanskrit literature, philosophy, and intellectual histories of religion in premodern South Asia. 
I have broader interests in Indo-Persian and Marathi literature, and the cultural history of Persianate Deccan.
